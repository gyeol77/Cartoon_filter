# Cartoon_filter
Just go through this filter and the picture changes like a cartoon!

It is a filter code that changes the image('image.jpg') on the desktop to a cartoon like Marvel Comics. For images that are not distinct, it may be difficult to convert.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations:
If the distinction between the background and the target(subject) in the image is not clear(if the color difference is not dramatic), the color may be lost during the conversion process, and light colors may be lost during the process of correcting the color clearly and simply like a cartoon.
The filter catches the outer contours of the subject well, but not the inner contours(such as the armor creases in the Iron Man image uploaded as an example).
It doesn't feel 100% completely cartoonish and feels somewhat awkward.
